/**
 * Class AppModule
 *
 * Represents an application module entity. This class is designed to be used as a part of the 
 * application's domain model, encapsulating the properties and behaviors related to a module 
 * within the app.
 * 
 * The `AppModule` class extends the `MagicObject` class, providing additional functionality 
 * such as serialization, deserialization, and possibly encryption/decryption, depending on 
 * the implementation of `MagicObject`.
 * 
 * This class can be used to represent various modules of an application, such as user management, 
 * content management, or other logical units that the application may be divided into.
