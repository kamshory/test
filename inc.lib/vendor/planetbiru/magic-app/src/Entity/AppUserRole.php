/**
 * Class AppUserRole
 *
 * Represents a user role within the application. The `AppUserRole` class is part of the `MagicApp\Entity` 
 * namespace and extends the `MagicObject` class, which provides core functionalities such as 
 * serialization, deserialization, and possibly encryption/decryption depending on the parent class implementation.
 *
 * The `AppUserRole` class is intended to define and manage roles that can be assigned to users within 
 * the application. These roles will typically be used to grant or restrict access to certain resources 
 * or operations based on the assigned role. Roles can correspond to specific sets of permissions or privileges.
 *
 * While the class does not currently have any properties or methods, it can be extended in the future to 
 * include attributes such as role name, description, permissions, and any other relevant data associated 
 * with user roles.
