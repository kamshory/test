/**
 * Class AppModuleGroup
 *
 * Represents a group of application modules. This class serves as a container or 
 * organizational unit for managing multiple modules within the application.
 * 
 * The `AppModuleGroup` class extends the `MagicObject` class, allowing it to inherit 
 * functionalities such as serialization, deserialization, and possibly encryption/decryption,
 * depending on the implementation of `MagicObject`.
 * 
 * This class can be used to logically group related application modules together, 
 * allowing for easier management and organization of the application's structure.
