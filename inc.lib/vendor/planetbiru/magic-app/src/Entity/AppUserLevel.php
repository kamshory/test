/**
 * Class AppUserLevel
 *
 * Represents a user level or role within the application. The `AppUserLevel` class is part 
 * of the `MagicApp\Entity` namespace and extends the `MagicObject` class, inheriting functionalities 
 * such as serialization, deserialization, and potentially encryption/decryption.
 * 
 * The `AppUserLevel` class is used to define different levels or roles assigned to users within 
 * the application. These roles can determine user permissions, access control, and other 
 * user-specific behavior based on their assigned level.
 *
 * Although the class currently does not contain any properties or methods, it can be expanded 
 * in the future to include attributes such as role names, permissions, descriptions, or 
 * any other relevant data tied to user roles.
