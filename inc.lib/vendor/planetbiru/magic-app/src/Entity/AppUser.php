/**
 * Class AppUser
 *
 * Represents a user in the application. The `AppUser` class is part of the `MagicApp\Entity` 
 * namespace and extends the `MagicObject` class, inheriting its functionalities such as 
 * serialization, deserialization, and possibly encryption/decryption.
 * 
 * This class can be used to model an individual user within the application, allowing 
 * for user-related properties (e.g., username, email, roles) and behaviors (e.g., authentication, authorization) 
 * to be encapsulated in a single object.
 *
 * As the class currently has no properties or methods, it may serve as a basic structure 
 * that can be expanded with additional user-related attributes and methods in the future.
