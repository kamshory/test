/**
 * Class ListFormData
 *
 * Represents a form structure designed to manage and organize filtering and data controls 
 * within a list UI. This class serves as a container for filter controls (e.g., search fields, 
 * date pickers, checkboxes) and data controls (e.g., display settings, sorting, pagination). 
 * These controls enable users to interact with and manipulate the data displayed in the list.
 * 
 * The `ListFormData` class allows for easy configuration of various filters and data-related
 * controls, such as adding, removing, or modifying filters and data controls dynamically.
 * It also provides methods to manage the controls collectively, ensuring that the UI is 
 * adaptable and user-friendly for operations such as sorting, searching, and displaying data.
 * 
 * **Key Features**:
 * - Manage a list of filter controls, each representing a specific filter UI element.
 * - Manage a list of data controls, each representing a specific data-related UI element.
 * - Dynamic addition of filter and data controls.
 * - Chaining of method calls for adding controls and setting properties.
